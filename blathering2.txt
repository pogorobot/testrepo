I'm so excited! Tip-tap-typing away in grey on black! Boy howdy, the world sure is nearly at an end!
I wonder what it means to be alive? Cloud formations sure are startling, Bartholomew.
Is this the kind of existence you always hoped would come your way, before you existed? Doubtful, but promising!
There is always hope, do not forget this. Oh, darn, looks like you forgot already.
WHAT DID I JUST SAY??
In any case, it's time for me to go.
This nonsense doesn't write itself, you know.
